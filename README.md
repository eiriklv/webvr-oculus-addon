# Firefox WebVR Oculus Rift Enabler Add-on

This addon simply provides a shared library version of LibOVR so that
Firefox can access it to interact with Oculus Rift headsets.  It
also flips the "dom.vr.enabled" preference to "true" upon installation.
It has no other functionality.

For build instructions for the native Oculus library pieces, see build/README.
