These are hacky build scripts intended to create dynamic libraries for
LibOVR.  To use them, download the Oculus SDK for your platform, create
a LibOVR/build directory, and copy the appropriate script into that
directory.  Then run it from that directory.  It'll pick up the sources
from ../Src and build.

The OSX script here will work either with a osxcross environment set up
under Linux or natively on OSX.
